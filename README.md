# Vybe DEX

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a Decentralized Exchange where users can connect their wallets to buy/sell Crypto.

You'll need your own Trading View chart and datasources to run it.

MixPanel was used as event analytics platform, you may remove those references when running this yourself.
